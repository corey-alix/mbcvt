    Dear 2024 Campers,
    <span class="br"></span>
    I hope this message finds you well and eagerly anticipating another wonderful camping season at Millbrook
    Campground.

    In anticipation of state and local tax increases and inflation in general, I must share this burden with you by
    increasing rates.

    <span class="br"></span>

    <em>Effective for the 2025 camping season, the seasonal rate will be <b>$1950 per site</b>.</em>

    <span class="br"></span>

    To help offset this increase, I am offering a <b>$100</b> discount for those who pay in full before
    October. The seasonal cost will be <b>$1850 per site</b> if paid in full before <b>October 1st, 2024</b>.

    <span class="br"></span>

    For campers that wish to leave their camper on site over the winter, the cost will be <b>$300</b> for the winter
    and that will be applied to your 2025 seasonal rate. The winter storage fee will be due by <b>October 1st,
        2024</b>.

    <span class="br"></span>

    I understand that change requires reflection, but I assure you that this adjustment will prove necessary to
    sustain the high quality experience you expect from Millbrook Campground.

    <span class="br"></span>

    I am committed to providing you with a beautiful, memorable and peaceful experience. Thank you for your
    understanding and continued support and I want to seeing each and every one of you back here for a
    fantastic 2025.
</p>
