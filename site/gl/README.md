This should be a double-entry GL form where user can enter date and then two or more transactions, where the debit columns is equal to the credit column.  By creating an account number for each campsite, we should be able to have a site-level transaction report.  We can bill sites (water leak at 12, etc.) or the entire property.  It give ultimate flexibility with minimal UX.


The layout should be tabular, with an editor appearing in the active row (one row at a time).
Similar to a spreadsheet, the user can tab through the columns and rows but must be mobile first.
